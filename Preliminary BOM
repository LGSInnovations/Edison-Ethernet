Downstream USB Power Switching
•	1x 1.0uF 
•	2x LEDs Power Indicators (Optional)
•	2x 330Ω/511Ω LED Resistors (Optional)
•	3x 0.1uF 
•	1x 47uF 
•	1x 140mA/60V Polyfuses   Overcurrent/Overvoltage Protection
•	1x Diodes   Reverse-current protection
•	**USB Power Supplies are ganged together in this case, requiring fewer parts but not allowing separate port power control.
Downstream USB Hardware
•	2x 150uF Tantalum Capacitors Used on SMSC Board
•	2x Shielded USB Connector  Of whatever form factor works –technically, they should be USB-A
Upstream USB Hardware
•	**Upstream USB will be connected directly to the Edison’s Hirose connector. Edison’s bus is powered, which might infer that our block be bus-powered and connected directly to the Edison’s power source. However, I am not quite sure how to connect this yet. It will need a jumper/toggle to switch between programming mode (disconnecting the LAN board’s USB connection entirely) and use mode (connected to the LAN board). No real hardware will be necessary (no USB connector, etc) besides some filtering but I need to sketch and think on this a little bit more, and review some more schematics. 
Optional EEPROM
•	10kΩ Resistor
•	0.1 uF Capacitor  Filtering
Ethernet
•	4x 49.9Ω Resistor Ethernet Tx/Rx pair Line Termination Resistors
